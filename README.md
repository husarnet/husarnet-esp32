> [!CAUTION]
> Husarnet for ESP32 has undergone a major refactor making it compatible with the latest upstream core codebase, latest ESP-IDF releases and newest Espressif microcontrollers. Because of that, code in **this repository is outdated** and it should not be used for new designs. It may or may not be updated to reflect the changes later in the future.

# Husarnet for ESP32

Husarnet is a low latency, lightweight, privacy preserving P2P VPN. If you want
to know more go to the [Husarnet's webpage](https://husarnet.com/) or directly
to the [documentation page](https://docs.husarnet.com/).

## Installation and usage

[Arduino](http://docs.husarnet.com/docs/begin-esp32)

[Platformio](http://docs.husarnet.com/docs/begin-esp32-platformio)

## Examples

You'll find full examples in our [examples](examples) directory. Code should work for both Arduino and Platformio variants.

Start with a [simple-webserver](examples/simple-webserver) for a fairly minimal example.
